    <h2>The Benefits of Daily Walking: How It Can Change Your Life</h2>
 <p><u>Walking</u> every morning reduces the risk of heart disease,
     lowers blood pressure and LDL (the “bad” cholesterol), and strengthens the heart,” explains Dalia McCoy, MD, family medicine specialist at Cleveland Clinic.
      “Walking helps the heart be more efficient. As your fitness improves,
       your heart becomes more effective with each pump you perform for that
        type of exercise.” Never Miss a McCoy also says walking helps reduce stress,
     aids in weight l, improves the immune system, all while protecting joints, as it is a low-impact exercise. It also reduces the risk of cancer. 
     </p>
<blockquote><em>“Several studies show that doing two-and-a-half to five hours of moderate-intensity exercise per week, such as walking, can help reduce the risk of certain cancers such as colon, breast, endometrial, kidney, liver,
      multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.”</em></blockquote>
